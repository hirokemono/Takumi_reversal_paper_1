Schematic diagram of energy flow for the equatorially symmetric and antisymmetric components of kinetic energy. 
The energy flow in the stable dipole phase is shown in the left, the change of the energy flow in the reversal phase is shown in the right. 
%And, the change of the energy flow in the exceptional case is shown in the right.

Schematic diagram of energy transfer for the equatorially symmetric and antisymmetric components of kinetic energy. 
The energy transfer in the stable dipole phase is shown in the left, and the change of the energy transfer in the reversal phase is shown in the right. 
%And, the change of the energy flow in the exceptional case is shown in the right.

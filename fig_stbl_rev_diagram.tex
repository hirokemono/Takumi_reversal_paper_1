Schematic diagram of energy transfer to/from the kinetic energy for the equatorially symmetric and antisymmetric flows.

{\color{blue}
The energy transfer in the stable dipole phase is shown in the left, and the change of the energy transfer in the reversal phase is shown in the right. 
Solid arrows indicate amplitudes of the energy fluxes, and dotted arrows indicate change of the amplitude of the works of the induction, inertia, and buoyancy in the reversal phase from the stable phase.

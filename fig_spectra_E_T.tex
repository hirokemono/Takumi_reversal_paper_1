as a function of spherical harmonic order, $m$. 
The sphere averaged component $T_{0}^{0}$ is excluded in the temperature plot.
Spectra of equatorially symmetric and antisymmetric components are plotted by filled and open symbols, respectively.
Spectra in stable and reversal periods are shown by red and blue colors, respectively.

\caption{
Time evolution of (a) the dipole tilt angle, magnetic energy of the equatorially symmetric (b) and antisymmetric (c) components, (d) and (e) energy transfers and their deviations from their time means for the equatorially symmetric component, respectively, and (f) and (g) energy transfers and their deviations from their time means for the equatorially antisymmetric component, respectively.
In (d)--(g), positive energy transfers (energy input) and negative ones (energy output) are plotted by solid and dashed lines, respectively.

% Temporal variations of symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane during polarity reversals.
(a) Time evolution of the dipole tilt angle, (b) time evolution of the equatorially symmetric and antisymmetric temperature, and (c)--(e) filtered radial magnetic field on the outer boundary (left column) and volume rendering images of the temperature (right column) at $t = 13.0$, $13.51$, and $14.0$ in the unit of the magnetic diffusion time from top to bottom.

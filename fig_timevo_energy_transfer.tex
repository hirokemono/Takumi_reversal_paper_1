\caption{
Time evolution of (a) the dipole tilt angle, kinetic energy of the equatorially symmetric (b) and antisymmetric (c) components, (d) and (e) energy transfers and their deviations from their time means for the equatorially symmetric component, respectively, and (f) and (g) energy transfers and their deviations from their time means for the equatorially antisymmetric component, respectively.
In (d)--(g), the buoyancy, inertial, work of Lorentz force, and viscous dissipation are plotted by red, green, blue, and black lines, respectively.
Positive energy transfers (energy input) and negative ones (energy output) are plotted by solid and dashed lines, respectively.

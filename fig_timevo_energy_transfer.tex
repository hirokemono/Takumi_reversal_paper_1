\caption{
Time evolution of (a) the dipole tilt angle, (b) kinetic energy of the equatorially symmetric (red line) and antisymmetric (black line) components, (c) and (d) energy fluxes and their deviations from their time means for the equatorially symmetric component, respectively, and (e) and (f) energy flows and their deviations from their time means for the equatorially antisymmetric component, respectively.
In (c)--(f), the buoyancy flux, inertial, work of Lorentz force, and viscous dissipation are plotted by red, green, blue, and black lines, respectively.
Positive energy flows (energy input) and negative ones (energy output) are plotted by solid and dashed lines, respectively.

\section{Results}
\label{section:results}

We performed a dynamo simulation with $E = 6.0 \times 10^{-4}$, $Ra_f = 2000$, $Pr = 1.0$, and $Pm = 5.0$. 
The dimensionless time, $t$, is scaled by the viscous diffusion time, $\tau_\nu = D^2 / \nu$, whereas the magnetic diffusion time, $\tau_\eta = D^2 / \eta = Pm D^2 / \nu = 5 \tau_\nu$ is used to show the results of time evolution.
The simulation was performed for approximately $85 \tau_\eta$, and the average ratio of magnetic to kinetic energies, $E_{\rm mag} / E_{\rm kin}$, was approximately 0.63. 
The dipole tilt angle, $\theta_D$, between the directions of rotation axis and the magnetic dipole moment was calculated from the radial component of the magnetic field with spherical harmonic degree one  at the CMB.

The result shows that there are periods during which the dipole field was stable and those during which 13 polarity reversals and 6 excursions occurred (see Fig.~\ref{fig:sph_shell_275_full}).
In the present study, we choose 8 periods shown by double headed arrows in Fig.~\ref{fig:sph_shell_275_full} including these polarity reversals, and investigate energy transfer among the kinetic and magnetic energies for the equatorially symmetric and antisymmetric components. 
We also carried out 7 simulations starting from snapshots in Period 1, 2 and 3. 
These results were found to depart from the original result except for the case Retry 3-2, but these retried cases also include polarity reversals and excursions (see Fig.~\ref{fig:dipole_tilt_retries}). 
We will discuss the reason why these retried cases give rise to different results in the discussion section.

\subsection{Characteristics of the fields during polarity reversals}

First, we investigate characteristics of the temperature field during a polarity reversal by choosing a result between $13.0 \le t/\tau_{\eta} \le 14.0$. 
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:temperature_rendering}b, the equatorially antisymmetric component of the temperature is larger than the equatorially symmetric component of the temperature during the polarity reversals and excursions, while the equatorially symmetric component of the temperature is approximately 1.5 times larger than the equatorially antisymmetric component. 
Volume rendering images of the temperature show that hot material rises strongly in the southern hemisphere during the polarity reversal, and that hot regions inside the tangent cylinder can be found in the both hemisphere before and after the reversal event
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:temperature_rendering} and movie in the supplement materials). 
However, any feature corresponding to the temperature does not appear in the radial magnetic field at the outer boundary of the spherical shell, 
because the upward flow along with the plumes must be diverged near the CMB and the magnetic lines of force also diverge with the diverging flow.

Secondly, we take time averages of the fields during the stable dipole and reversing periods. 
We choose the amplitude of the axial dipole component given by the Gauss coefficient $g_{1}^{0}$ at $r = 2.8$ obtained from the poloidal magnetic field at the outer boundary of the shell, $r = r_{o}$. 
We define the reversing periods when $\left| g_{1}^{0} \right|^2 < 4.9 \times 10^{-5}$ in the present study (see the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:sph_shell_275_full}).

Fig.~\ref{fig:KE_temp_spectra_m} shows spectra of the kinetic energy and square of temperature for the equatorially symmetric and antisymmetric components
with respect to the spherical harmonic order, $m$, for the Retry 1-1 case.
We compare spectra obtained in polarity reversal periods with those in polarity stable periods.
Spectra for the non-axisymmetric components ($m \ne 0$) show that the kinetic energy and square of temperature for the equatorially symmetric component are larger than those for the equatorially antisymmetric component irrespective of stable and reversal periods.
Any significant difference is not found between those in stable and reversal periods, although the kinetic energy in reversal periods is slightly larger than that in stable periods.

On the other hand, amplitudes of the axisymmetric component $(m = 0)$ show that the toroidal kinetic energy for the equatorially antisymmetric flow in reversal periods is approximately twice of that in stable periods, but that the toroidal kinetic energy for the equatorially symmetric flow in reversal periods is nearly equal to that in stable periods.
Consequently, the toroidal kinetic energy for the equatorially antisymmetric and axisymmetric components is larger than that for the equatorially symmetric and  axisymmetric components  in reversal periods.
It is noted that there is no remarkable difference between poloidal kinetic energy for the equatorially symmetric and antisymmetric flows irrespective of reversal and stable periods.
The spectrum of the square of the temperature has similar change as that for the toroidal kinetic energy from the stable period to the reversal period.
The square of equatorially antisymmetric temperature with the axial symmetry in reversal periods is approximately three times larger than that in stable periods.
A difference of the temperature spectrum from the toroidal kinetic energy spectrum is that the equatorially antisymmetric component of the axisymmetric temperature is larger than that of the non-axisymmetric temperature.
Consequently, the equatorially antisymmetric temperature is larger than the equatorially symmetric temperature during reversal periods (see Fig.~\ref{fig:temperature_rendering}). 
In addition, the equatorially antisymmetric temperature with the axial symmetry is approximately 1.5 times larger than the equatorially symmetric temperature with the axial symmetry even in stable periods.

\subsection{Investigation of energy transfers}
\label{sec:energy_transfer}

We investigate the energy transfer during polarity reversals through separation of the flow, magnetic field and temperature into the equatorially symmetric and anti-symmetric components as in eqs.~(\ref{eq:energy_us}) and (\ref{eq:energy_ua}).

First, we investigate time evolution of the energy transfers for one polarity reversal in Retry 1-1 case (see Fig.~\ref{fig:dipole_tilt_retries}). 
Fig.~\ref{fig:energy_flux_evolution_retry1_1} shows the time evolution of the dipole tilt angle, and the energy transfers between kinetic energies for the equatorially symmetric and antisymmetric flows.
 As described in the previous subsection, the kinetic energy for $\bvec{u}^a$ does not overcome that for $\bvec{u}^s$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:energy_flux_evolution_retry1_1}b).
In addition, there is no significant variation in the overall amplitude of energy transfers during the stable and reversal periods (Fig.~\ref{fig:energy_flux_evolution_retry1_1}c and e).
Energy transfer by the buoyancy is the largest energy input to the kinetic energy for both of $\bvec{u}^s$ and $\bvec{u}^a$.
The work of Lorentz force is always negative, which means that the kinetic energy for both $\bvec{u}^s$ and $\bvec{u}^a$ is transferred to the magnetic energy.
The advection always transfers energy from $\bvec{u}^s$ to $\bvec{u}^a$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:energy_flux_evolution_retry1_1}c and e), although energy transfer by the advection is the smallest.
Fig.~\ref{fig:energy_flux_evolution_retry1_1}d and f shows deviations of the energy transfers from the time average over the period for Retry 1-1, in which one polarity reversal and one excursion occurred at around $t = 33.0$ and at around $t = 36.2$, respectively (Fig.~\ref{fig:energy_flux_evolution_retry1_1}a).
In the both events, deviation of the work by Lorentz force with the equatorial symmetry obviously increases, whereas that with the equatrial antisymmetry does not change significantly.
The former corresponds to decrease of energy transfer to the magnetic field.
The increase of the work by the buoyancy and advection to the equatorially antisymmetric flow is more significant than the work by Lorentz force.
The work by the advection increases first, and that by the buoyancy in the next. 
The energy transfer by inertia increases the axisymmetric toroidal flow with the equatorial antisymmetry (see Fig.~\ref{fig:KE_temp_spectra_m}), because the buoyancy can be only the energy input to the poloidal flow.

\input{fig_ave_perturbation.tex}
\input{fig_stbl_rev_diagram.tex}

Next, we investigate the energy transfer to the kinetic energy for the 11 periods in total including the stable and reversal periods (see Figs.\ \ref{fig:sph_shell_275_full} and \ref{fig:dipole_tilt_retries}).
We took time averages of the work by the Lorentz force, advection, and buoyancy to the equatorially symmetric and anti-symmetric flows in reversal periods, and calculated their deviations from the time averages.
The deviation of the work by Lorentz force and advection is similar to each other in the all periods, while the deviation of the work by buoyance shows large variability among the periods (see Fig.~\ref{Fig:Change_flux_summary_6grp}).
The energy transfer from the equatorially symmetric flow to the magnetic field decreases (i.e.\ the deviation of the work by Lorentz force increases). 
The energy transfer to $\bvec{u}^a$ by the work of Lorentz force also decreases, although its amplitude is small.
The largest change is found in the energy transfer from $\bvec{u}^s$ to $\bvec{u}^a$ due to the work by advection. 
The work by buoyancy caused by equatorially antisymmetric temperature $T^{a}$ also increases in most of the cases, although its amplitude is smaller than that by the advection. 
The temperature structure during the reversal in Fig.~\ref{fig:temperature_rendering} and change of the kinetic energy spectra in Fig.~\ref{fig:KE_temp_spectra_m} suggest that the intense equatorially antisymmetric flow with the axial symmetry is induced by the advection to sustain the thermal wind inside the tangent cylinder. 

Taking into account the time evolution of the energy transfer in Fig.~\ref{fig:energy_flux_evolution_retry1_1}, we can summarize the process of the polarity reversal as shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:schematic_reversal}. 
First, the energy transfer to the magnetic energy decreases. 
Secondly, the advection transfers energy from the equatorially symmetric flow to the axisymmetric zonal flow inside the tangent cylinder in the either hemisphere to sustain the thermal wind balance. 
Finally, the buoyancy inside the tangent cylinder drives upwelling flow and enhances the equatorially antisymmetric temperature.

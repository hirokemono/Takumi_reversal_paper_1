\caption{
Time evolution of the dipole tilt angle in six retried runs. 
The result in the original run is plotted by gray lines. 
Re-calculations in Period 1, 2 and 3 are shown in the top, middle, and bottom panels, respectively. 
Double headed arrows show periods during which data analyses are carried out.

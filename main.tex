\begin{abstract}
The Earth has a magnetic field with a dominant dipole moment that is nearly parallel to the axis of Earth’s rotation. 
Paleomagnetic measurements have shown that the geomagnetic field has reversed its polarity many times. It is widely accepted that the geomagnetic field is sustained by flow motion in the Earth’s outer core, so-called dynamo action. 
Some geodynamo simulations have been carried out to investigate the physical process of geomagnetic polarity reversals, and the equatorially antisymmetric flow during reversals is found to be stronger than that during stable periods. 
On the other hand, convective motions in a rotating spherical shell have characteristics that the equatorially symmetric flow is dominant due to the effect of rotation. 
We have performed a geodynamo simulation with the dipole reversals, and  analyzed energy fluxes transferred between the equatorially symmetric and antisymmetric flow. 
The results show that the energy flux transferred to the antisymmetric flow is generally small. 
The energy flux transferred to the antisymmetric flow increases toward a polarity reversal in the following. i) The energy conversion rate from the symmetric flow to the magnetic field decreases, ii) the energy conversion rate from the symmetric flow to the antisymmetric flow by the advection increases, and iii) the energy injection by the buoyancy force into the antisymmetric flow increases. 
As a result of i)-iii), the energy of the antisymmetric flow increases. 
In addition, contribution to the energy flux transferred to the antisymmetric flow is by the energy conversion due to the advection.

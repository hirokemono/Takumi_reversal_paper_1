\caption{
Time evolution of kinetic and magnetic energies (top panel) and the dipole tile angle (bottom panel) throughout the present simulation (approximately 85 magnetic diffusion times).
The dipole tilt angle between $16.2 \le t / \tau_{\eta} \le 26.9$ is not plotted due to missing of the data. 
After $t = 5.0 \tau_{\eta}$, 12 polarity reversals occurred.
Double headed arrows in the bottom panel show eight periods during which data analyses are carried out.

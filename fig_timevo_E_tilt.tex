\caption{
Time evolution of kinetic and magnetic energies (top panel) and the dipole tilt angle (bottom panel) throughout the present simulation (approximately 120 magnetic diffusion times). In the bottom panel, the stable period with the Gauss coefficients $|g_{1}^{0}| > 7.0 \times 10^{-3}$ and reversal periods ($|g_{1}^{0}| < 7.0 \times 10^{-3}$) are shown by red and green, respectively. 
In the bottom panel, the green shaded area corresponds to the occurrence during polarity reversal periods.
% The dipole tilt angle between $16.2 \le t / \tau_{\eta} \le 26.9$ is not plotted due to missing of the data. 
After $t = 5.0 \tau_{\eta}$, 12 polarity reversals occurred.
Double headed arrows in the bottom panel show 11 %eight 
periods during which data analyses are carried out.
